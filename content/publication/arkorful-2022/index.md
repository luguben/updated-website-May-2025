abstract: The proliferation and adoption of phones and other emerging technologies
  in health care is significantly growing in Ghana. Though tapping into this technology
  innovation could tremendously improve health care in resource deficient settings,
  there is a dearth of research on adoption antecedents. Drawing strength from behavior
  studies anchored on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), our study proposed a model,
  and further sampled 386 respondents to predict mobile health adoption behavior.
  Empirical results of our study revealed that attitude, subjective norm, perceived
  behavior control, personal moral norm, and language all had a significant positive
  relationship with adoption intention. Furthermore, adoption intention was also revealed
  to have a significant positive relationship with behavior. And finally, Internet
  bandwidth was revealed to significantly moderate the relationship between adoption
  intention and actual adoption behavior. Based on the results, further insights for
  stakeholders and policy, implications for accelerating mobile health adoption, and
  suggestions for future research are subsequently delineated.

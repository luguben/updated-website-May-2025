abstract: The daunting global challenges saddling polities and governments alike have
  resultantly created a situation whereby governments and corporate civil society
  have inadvertently reneged on delivering public good and services to citizens. In
  ensuring and strengthening a public-private actor synergy, with particular emphasis
  on leveraging acquired knowledge and skills of diaspora-based students, social entrepreneurship
  activities could be harnessed to provide sustainable remedies to social challenges
  such as unemployment, famine amongst others by utilizing social entrepreneurship
  as a tool. Using the theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical framework, the
  study elicited data from 322 respondents to empirically investigate determinants
  of social entrepreneurship intentions of Ghanaian students, with the moderating
  role of institutional support. Study results revealed that sense of social responsibility
  and service learning have significant relationship with social entrepreneurship
  intention. However, social volunteering experience had no significant relationship.
  Moreover, whereas attitude to social entrepreneurship intention demonstrated a positive
  relationship, institutional support as a moderator was also revealed to influence
  the relationship between attitude and social entrepreneurship intention. From the
  study findings, we discourse on the implications for social entrepreneurship in
  Ghana to policy makers and stakeholders.

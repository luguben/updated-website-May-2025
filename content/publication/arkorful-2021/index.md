abstract: Effective communication between patients and nurses is cardinal to health
  care The study seeks to explore barriers to effective therapeutic communication
  between patients and nurses in randomly selected health facilities in the Kumasi
  metropolis, Ashanti region, Ghana. The study employed an exploratory study to interview
  60 respondents comprising 30 nurses and patients each, using an unstructured interview
  guide. In addition to nurses' and patients'perceived barriers, the study revealed
  the health environment–related barriers. Patients-related barriers include individual
  sociodemographic attributes, patient–nurse relationship, erroneous impression, and
  language barrier. Other identified nurses-related barriers include human resource
  challenges, patients' distrust in nurses’ competency, interference from patients’
  relations, inadequate knowledge, patient’s dissatisfaction with output, patients’
  emotional fluctuations. Health environment–related barriers also include excessive
  workload, unconducive environment, and environmental changes. Given the relevance
  of therapeutic communication to health service, the study, among other things recommends
  that efforts be exerted by sector actors to address the challenges and help promote
  quality in health-care service and delivery.

abstract: Social media use in local government has gained prominence in the last few
  years worldwide, but little research has been done concerning users' needs and experiences.
  In addressing this gap, this paper aims at understanding social media use experiences
  in local government from the individual users in the metropolitan assembly's viewpoint.
  As local government agencies implement social media tools at all levels, we tend
  to explore the motivations that entice individuals to use these services and how
  information sharing can moderate the intention to use and actual use. We built a
  social media utilization model based on the literature review and extended the Delone
  and Mcleans framework by adding other constructs existing in other studies as the
  theoretical framework. Using a quantitative approach to the study, structured online
  questions were distributed. The results of a survey of 360 respondents of Accra
  Metropolitan Assembly social media users in Ghana indicate that information quality,
  service quality, system quality, and Trust remain the crucial determinants of intention
  to use and actual usage. Our study spotlights the importance of understanding the
  dynamics by which users utilize social media platforms.

abstract: Fraud remains a challenge for corporate and local governments in Ghana.
  Therefore, this study probes behavior predictors using the fraud diamond theory.
  The study used questionnaires to draw data. Results of data (n = 624) analysis based
  on the structural equation modeling confirmed the positive relationship between
  pressure, opportunity, rationalization and capability, and behavior intention. Opposed
  to erstwhile for-profit studies, rationalization was dominant, emphasizing nuanced
  behavior outcomes across domains. Situating the theory within the local government
  context, the investigation backs up the theory's suitability for behavior prediction
  whilst inter alia forefronting anti-fraud success as contingent on decoupling public
  administration from partisan politics.

abstract: Though the integration of technology into the health sector has been touted
  as one of the conduits for enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in health and
  service delivery, research reports of not only a slow pace of adoption, but also
  medical practitioner's negative tendency regarding technology adoption. Considering
  that medical students are likely to constitute the future work force to use technology
  for enhancing accuracy in medical decisions, their intention to use technology constitutes
  a cardinal factor for guiding the implementation of technology-based initiatives
  in healthcare settings. By integrating descriptive norm, the study seeks to extend
  the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate correlates of prospective users'
  behavioral characteristics relative to technology adoption. A field survey is conducted
  with 322 medical students from different medical schools undertaking mandatory clinicals
  in health facilities in Ghana. The structural equation modeling analysis of collected
  data revealed that, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and
  descriptive norm, all have significant positive relationship with student's technology
  adoption intention. The results of data analysis further revealed that, the core
  TPB constructs contributed 26% of the variance in technology adoption intention
  whiles the extended variable contributed to increasing the explanation of variance
  in student's adoption intention to 33%. Hence, the inclusion of descriptive norm
  increased the explained variance by 7% (Î”R2 = 7%, p <.001). The results confirm
  the predictive potential and appropriateness of the TPB model. Arising from the
  empirical results, study implications are discussed.

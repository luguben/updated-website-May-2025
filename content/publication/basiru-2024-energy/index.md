abstract: "Energy efficiency labeling is an effective method of altering peoples'
  consumption patterns and motivating them to purchase energy-efficient appliances
  to help reduce environmental pollution and carbon emissions. However, few studies
  have explored the connection between energy efficiency labels and the intention
  to purchase energy-efficient appliances. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior,
  this study develops a theoretical model to examine the mechanism through which energy
  efficiency labels impact urban residents’ intention to purchase energy-efficient
  household appliances in Ghana. A total of 507 valid responses were obtained using
  a questionnaire survey, and structural equation modeling was employed to analyze
  these data. The results indicate that attitude toward energy-efficient appliances,
  green trust, and perceived behavioral control significantly and positively influence
  the intention to purchase energy-efficient appliances. Contrary to our expectations,
  the influence of subjective norms was determined to be insignificant. This study
  also revealed a direct, positive, and significant impact of energy efficiency labels
  on attitude and green trust and an indirect impact on purchase intention via green
  trust. The findings underscore the prominence of energy efficiency labels in driving
  consumer behavior toward the purchase of energy-efficient appliances. This study’s
  findings could be useful in encouraging governments, policymakers, manufacturers,
  importers, and retailers to adopt effective measures to promote the use of energy-efficient
  appliances among households in Ghana. Graphical abstract: (Figure presented.)"

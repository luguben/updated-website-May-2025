 abstract = {The transition from military to democratic rule has inter alia culminated in entrenching elections as a political culture. This has sparked longstanding debate about voting behavior determinants in Ghana. Therefore, this study probes voters behavior infleuncers using a conceptual model anchored on the theory of reasoned action. Data was drawn using questionnaires. Data (n = 401) analysis results using the structural equation modelling technique revealed a significant relationship between celebrity endorsement, ideology, manifesto and debate, and attitude. Further, celebrity endorsement, debate and attitude were revealed to significantly relate votersâ€™ voting intention. Given these outcomes, implications and suggestions for further research, are outlined.},

abstract: The transition from military to democratic rule has inter alia culminated
  in entrenching elections as a political culture. This has sparked longstanding debate
  about voting behavior determinants in Ghana. Therefore, this study probes voters
  behavior infleuncers using a conceptual model anchored on the theory of reasoned
  action. Data was drawn using questionnaires. Data (n = 401) analysis results using
  the structural equation modelling technique revealed a significant relationship
  between celebrity endorsement, ideology, manifesto and debate, and attitude. Further,
  celebrity endorsement, debate and attitude were revealed to significantly relate
  votersâ€™ voting intention. Given these outcomes, implications and suggestions for
  further research, are outlined.

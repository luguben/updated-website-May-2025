abstract: Food and agricultural policy research is often challenged with the issue
  of commercializing the application of transgenic technology in food production.
  There is a need for an enhanced understanding of how risk and benefit information
  influence the general attitudes of farmers towards genetically modified (GM) technology.
  This paper contributes to existing literature by studying the various adoption factors
  that influence Ghanaian farmers' attitudes toward GM crop technology by using risk
  perception as a mediating tool. An empirical choice of methodology which is structural
  equation analysis was incorporated in this study. We report that, after conducting
  a survey among 325 respondents, Ghanaian farmers' negative attitudes toward GM technology
  is as a result of the influence of risk perception on the attributes of the innovative
  technology (relative advantage, trialability, mass media, and interpersonal relations).
  We employ a conceptual framework that incorporates Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT)
  and Risk analysis to assess the relationships between the attributes and attitudes
  towards GM technology. It was revealed in the structural equation modeling (SEM)
  analysis that, risk perception exerts a significant influence on the effects of
  the attributes of GM technology adoption thus reflecting a negative attitude towards
  the adoption of the related technology. We further discussed the implications for
  emphasizing the need for a positive attitude toward the acceptance and adoption
  of GM technology in Ghana.

abstract: Though health insurance policies remain critical to eliminating healthcare
  access barriers, population-wide subscription in Ghana however remains unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, this study, while employing a questionnaire survey to elicit data (n=
  312) analyzed via the structural equation modeling technique, investigates individual
  health insurance subscription underpinnings using the theory of planned behavior.
  The results of data analysis affirmed attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavior
  control as positively related to health insurance subscription. Similarly, results
  further revealed personal norm and descriptive norm as significantly related to
  intention, testifying to individuals’ subscription as not anchored on a single factor,
  but rather on a confluence of behavior-driven elements. The current study, in addition
  to affirming the TPB’s predictive potency, also enriches health insurance research,
  and underscores the much often-disregarded behavior constituents as imperative to
  health policy design and implementation. In view of the study results, implications
  for augmenting subscription, and suggestions for further research are subsequently
  delineated.

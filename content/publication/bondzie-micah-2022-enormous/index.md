abstract: The enormous potential inherent in the use of technological enhancements
  has subsequently informed the deployment of technologies into mainstream health
  service and delivery. However, a larger population of health technology consumers,
  specifically patients, are touted to be significantly constrained in its usage.
  Against this backdrop, our study employs an integrated model anchored on the technology
  acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior to investigate patients' electronic
  health use. Our study elicited data from 360 respondents, of which 311 were deemed
  feasible for the study. Structural equation modeling analysis of data revealed perceived
  usefulness and perceived ease of use has a relevant positive effect on attitude.
  Furthermore, the authors found; attitude, internet dependency, perceived behavioral
  control and the subjective norm also have a relevant positive impact on intention
  to use electronic health service. Premised on the findings, recommendations about
  enhancing consumer electronic health use and areas for further studies are successively
  delineated.

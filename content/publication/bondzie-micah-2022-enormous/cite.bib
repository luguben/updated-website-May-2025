 abstract = {The enormous potential inherent in the use of technological enhancements has subsequently informed the deployment of technologies into mainstream health service and delivery. However, a larger population of health technology consumers, specifically patients, are touted to be significantly constrained in its usage. Against this backdrop, our study employs an integrated model anchored on the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior to investigate patients' electronic health use. Our study elicited data from 360 respondents, of which 311 were deemed feasible for the study. Structural equation modeling analysis of data revealed perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use has a relevant positive effect on attitude. Furthermore, the authors found; attitude, internet dependency, perceived behavioral control and the subjective norm also have a relevant positive impact on intention to use electronic health service. Premised on the findings, recommendations about enhancing consumer electronic health use and areas for further studies are successively delineated.},

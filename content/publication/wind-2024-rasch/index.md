abstract: Researchers who use measurement models for evaluation purposes often select
  models with stringent requirements, such as Rasch models, which are parametric.
  Mokken Scale Analysis (MSA) offers a theory-driven nonparametric modeling approach
  that may be more appropriate for some measurement applications. Researchers have
  discussed using MSA as a preliminary procedure with which to evaluate data quality
  before applying a parametric model. However, the literature includes only a few
  examples in which researchers have integrated MSA techniques with parametric models
  throughout the analytic procedure. We consider a systematic approach for integrating
  results from nonparametric MSA techniques with parametric measurement models to
  evaluate measurement quality and construct scales with useful measurement properties.
  We use real-data illustrations and a simulation study to demonstrate and systematically
  explore our approach. We discuss implications for research and practice.

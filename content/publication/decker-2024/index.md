abstract: This article employs quantitative critical race theory (QuantCrit), set
  against a historical context backdrop, to understand key aspects of Black religious
  engagement and post-college educational pathways. The variables selected for this
  study illuminate post-graduation outcomes for Black students valued by the Freedmen’s
  Bureau and other similarly focused organizations that coalesced immediately before,
  during, and shortly after the American Civil War. Data from the 1979-80 National
  Survey of Black Americans (NSBA) provides the content for an analysis herein of
  Black Americans engaging in the church following college graduation and their pursuit
  of advanced degrees. This survey conducted roughly 100 years following the Civil
  War, has remained influential to policymakers to the present day and allows an opportunity
  to reflect on today’s views on Black education at this sesquicentennial juncture.
  So doing provides for a reconceptualization of Black post-college success as originally
  imagined by organizations dedicated to social and educational initiatives for freedmen
  and remains independent of the metrics that often obscure the landscape and perception
  of Black post-college success.

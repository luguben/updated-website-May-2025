abstract: "Objective: Health maintenance of the general public through vaccination
  is a significant component of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims
  to examine the perception of Nigerians toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: Informed
  by the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), 793 Nigerian participants completed
  a cross-sectional self-administered online survey to assess: (1) their perception
  of COVID-19 based on fear-mongering information on social media (2) the potential
  relationship between threat perception, efficacy, and fear associated with the COVID-19
  vaccine, vaccine hesitancy, and attitudes toward the decision to uptake the vaccine
  using structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, and (3) we further employed the
  use of the hierarchical regression analysis to test the moderating effect of mindful
  critical thinking between vaccine hesitancy and attitudes toward vaccines. Results:
  Most participants (65.7%) intend to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine. However, many people
  did not fear the disease (19.2%). Threat perception and efficacy were associated
  with a decision to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine via the mediation of attitudes toward
  vaccines. Previous vaccine hesitancy has no relationship with uptake decisions.
  The hierarchical regression analysis showed that participants exhibiting high critical
  thinking mindfulness were more interested in taking the vaccine. Conclusions: The
  findings of this study demonstrate that EPPM constructs are effective predictors
  of the public's decision to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine. This research highlights
  the theoretical and practical implications."

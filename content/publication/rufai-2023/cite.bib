 abstract = {Objective: Health maintenance of the general public through vaccination is a significant component of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to examine the perception of Nigerians toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: Informed by the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), 793 Nigerian participants completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey to assess: (1) their perception of COVID-19 based on fear-mongering information on social media (2) the potential relationship between threat perception, efficacy, and fear associated with the COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine hesitancy, and attitudes toward the decision to uptake the vaccine using structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, and (3) we further employed the use of the hierarchical regression analysis to test the moderating effect of mindful critical thinking between vaccine hesitancy and attitudes toward vaccines. Results: Most participants (65.7%) intend to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine. However, many people did not fear the disease (19.2%). Threat perception and efficacy were associated with a decision to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine via the mediation of attitudes toward vaccines. Previous vaccine hesitancy has no relationship with uptake decisions. The hierarchical regression analysis showed that participants exhibiting high critical thinking mindfulness were more interested in taking the vaccine. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that EPPM constructs are effective predictors of the public's decision to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine. This research highlights the theoretical and practical implications.},

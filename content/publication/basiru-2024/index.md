abstract: In this study, an attempt is made to understand the behavioral intentions
  towards climate change mitigation using Ajzen's framework of the Theory of Planned
  Behavior. It examines the factors that influence mitigation behavioral intentions
  among local people in Ghana. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique,
  the analysis finds that climate change knowledge, and the perceived risk of climate
  change have statistically significant impacts on attitudes towards mitigation of
  climate change. Subsequently, the study findings also show that mitigation attitude,
  subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have a statistically significant
  influence on behavioral intentions towards climate change mitigation. Moreover,
  the results illustrate that the strength of the significant association between
  perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions is greater compared with
  the significant association between subjective norms, attitude and behavioral intentions.
  The study findings will support government in the formulation of climate change
  mitigation policies and programs, ultimately aiding sustainable development. Finally,
  the study, through its limitations, offers suggestions for future studies.

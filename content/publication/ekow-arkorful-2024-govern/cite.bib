 abstract = {As global governments continue to inoculate populations in the aftermath of the SARS-CoV-19 epidemic, health protection and related problems such as vaccination reluctance have sparked conflicting emotions and discourses. Stakeholder concerns about vaccination promotion have arisen in this context. Consequently, this research investigates vaccination uptake behavior using an integrated framework that includes protective motivation theory and an extended version of the theory of planned behavior. Except for perceived severity, empirical study results based on the structural equation modeling technique demonstrated a positive relationship between PMT factors (i.e. perceived vulnerability, reaction efficacy, self-efficacy, and cost response) and intention to vaccinate. TPB factors (attitude, perceived behavior control, subjective norm, personal moral norm, and descriptive norm) were also found to have a positive connection with intention. The model’s utility and suitability are indicated by the predictive and explanatory potency score (R2 = .415). Study implications for COVID-19 vaccine uptake promotion and ideas for future investigations are explored in light of our findings.},

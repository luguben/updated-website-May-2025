abstract: As global governments continue to inoculate populations in the aftermath
  of the SARS-CoV-19 epidemic, health protection and related problems such as vaccination
  reluctance have sparked conflicting emotions and discourses. Stakeholder concerns
  about vaccination promotion have arisen in this context. Consequently, this research
  investigates vaccination uptake behavior using an integrated framework that includes
  protective motivation theory and an extended version of the theory of planned behavior.
  Except for perceived severity, empirical study results based on the structural equation
  modeling technique demonstrated a positive relationship between PMT factors (i.e.
  perceived vulnerability, reaction efficacy, self-efficacy, and cost response) and
  intention to vaccinate. TPB factors (attitude, perceived behavior control, subjective
  norm, personal moral norm, and descriptive norm) were also found to have a positive
  connection with intention. The model’s utility and suitability are indicated by
  the predictive and explanatory potency score (R2 = .415). Study implications for
  COVID-19 vaccine uptake promotion and ideas for future investigations are explored
  in light of our findings.

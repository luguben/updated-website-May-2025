abstract: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a surge in mask usage
  around the world. This situation could spur environmental consequences which when
  not well managed, may compound waste and waste management, and further drive the
  spread of viral infections. Therefore, this study explores the antecedents of mask
  waste separation behavior in Ghana using an integrated model composed of the theory
  of planned behavior and the norm activation model. With the use of the questionnaire
  survey approach, data was drawn from 570 respondents, and further analyzed using
  the structural equation modeling technique. Results revealed that the relationship
  between awareness of consequences and other constructs, except attitude, and the
  relationship between ascription of responsibility and other constructs, except attitude,
  are significant. Moreover, significant relationships between subjective norm and
  attitude, subjective norm and personal norm, and subjective norm and perceived behavior
  control were validated. However, no significant relationship exists between awareness
  of consequences and attitude, and between awareness of responsibility and attitude.
  On the basis of the study findings, insightful implications for policy and suggestions
  for future research are presented.

 abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a surge in mask usage around the world. This situation could spur environmental consequences which when not well managed, may compound waste and waste management, and further drive the spread of viral infections. Therefore, this study explores the antecedents of mask waste separation behavior in Ghana using an integrated model composed of the theory of planned behavior and the norm activation model. With the use of the questionnaire survey approach, data was drawn from 570 respondents, and further analyzed using the structural equation modeling technique. Results revealed that the relationship between awareness of consequences and other constructs, except attitude, and the relationship between ascription of responsibility and other constructs, except attitude, are significant. Moreover, significant relationships between subjective norm and attitude, subjective norm and personal norm, and subjective norm and perceived behavior control were validated. However, no significant relationship exists between awareness of consequences and attitude, and between awareness of responsibility and attitude. On the basis of the study findings, insightful implications for policy and suggestions for future research are presented.},

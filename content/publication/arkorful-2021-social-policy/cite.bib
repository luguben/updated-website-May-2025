 abstract = {Health insurance policies have become key social policy interventions incepted to extend healthcare to vulnerable populations. In this vein, Ghana devised a health insurance scheme in the year 2003. However, there have been concerns about quality, value, satisfaction and trust regarding healthcare and insurance usage. Using data drawn from 345 participants, our study investigates these dimensions to empirically test their predictive effects on the actual usage of health insurance. Data analysis results using the Structural Equation Modelling technique confirmed these dimensions as predictors of intention and actual usage. Our study delineates the practical, theoretical and policy implications of the study findings.},

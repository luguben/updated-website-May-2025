abstract: Health insurance policies have become key social policy interventions incepted
  to extend healthcare to vulnerable populations. In this vein, Ghana devised a health
  insurance scheme in the year 2003. However, there have been concerns about quality,
  value, satisfaction and trust regarding healthcare and insurance usage. Using data
  drawn from 345 participants, our study investigates these dimensions to empirically
  test their predictive effects on the actual usage of health insurance. Data analysis
  results using the Structural Equation Modelling technique confirmed these dimensions
  as predictors of intention and actual usage. Our study delineates the practical,
  theoretical and policy implications of the study findings.

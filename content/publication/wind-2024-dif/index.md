abstract: Mokken Scale Analysis (MSA) is a nonparametric approach that offers exploratory
  tools for understanding the nature of item responses while emphasizing invariance
  requirements. MSA is often discussed as it relates to Rasch measurement theory,
  which also emphasizes invariance, but uses parametric models. Researchers who have
  compared and combined MSA and Rasch approaches have generally concluded that these
  approaches offer complementary perspectives. However, researchers have not considered
  how the two approaches may provide insight related to examinee subgroups. Using
  a simulation and illustrative real data analysis, we propose an exploratory approach
  to integrating MSA and Rasch techniques to understand item fit as it relates to
  differences in item characteristics between examinee subgroups. Our results suggest
  that integrating complete-sample and subgroup-level MSA and Rasch model item fit
  analyses can provide insight into differences in item quality between subgroups.
  In some cases, misfit at the complete sample level corresponds to subgroup-related
  differences. On the other hand, fit at the complete sample level does not guarantee
  consistent measurement properties within subgroups. When subgroups are important
  for scale interpretation and use, our results suggest that conducting separate analyses
  within groups and considering their results with respect to those from the full
  sample may lend useful insight.

 abstract = {In this study, an attempt is made to understand the behavioral intentions towards climate change mitigation using Ajzen's framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior. It examines the factors that influence mitigation behavioral intentions among local people in Ghana. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique, the analysis finds that climate change knowledge, and the perceived risk of climate change have statistically significant impacts on attitudes towards mitigation of climate change. Subsequently, the study findings also show that mitigation attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have a statistically significant influence on behavioral intentions towards climate change mitigation. Moreover, the results illustrate that the strength of the significant association between perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions is greater compared with the significant association between subjective norms, attitude and behavioral intentions. The study findings will support government in the formulation of climate change mitigation policies and programs, ultimately aiding sustainable development. Finally, the study, through its limitations, offers suggestions for future studies.},

abstract: The pandemic outbreak has dealt consequences on global engagements and structures.
  With the ongoing search for pandemic-mitigating measures and the excesses (notably
  corruption) erupted in its wake, concerns have been raised about the decline in
  public trust, transparency and satisfaction â€“ particularly in Ghana. This situation
  has spurred multilevel governance discussions regarding pandemic management. Ensuingly
  characterising policy makers' propositions in this regard is the civil society's
  salience as a control valve to governance deficits like corruption. Therefore, transcending
  the anecdotal claims on civil society's efficacy, this study takes a state-society
  perspective to probe its relevance in fostering trust, transparency and satisfaction,
  relative to corruption-stricken pandemic governance. The current study engages the
  general systems theory as a conceptual lens. The structural equation modelling technique
  was used in analysing data (n = 519) gathered through the questionnaire survey approach.
  Though results of data analysis affirmed the negative effects of corruption on trust,
  transparency and satisfaction, the civil society received affirmation as an enhancer
  of trust, transparency and satisfaction. In view of these study findings, implications
  and future research suggestions are delimited.

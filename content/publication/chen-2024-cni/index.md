abstract: "Item response theory (IRT) is a modern psychometric framework for estimating
  respondents' latent traits (e.g., ability, attitude, and personality) based on their
  responses to a set of questions in psychological tests. The current study adopted
  an item response tree (IRTree) method, which combines the tree model with IRT models
  for handling the sequential process of responding to a test item, to score individual
  moral inclination for the CNI test—a broadly adopted model for examining humans’
  moral decision-making with three parameters generated: sensitivity to moral norms,
  sensitivity to consequences, and inaction preference. Compared to previous models
  for the CNI test, the resulting EIRTree-CNI Model is able to generate individual
  scores without increasing the number of items (thus, less subject fatigue or compromised
  response quality) or employing a post hoc approach that is deemed statistically
  suboptimal. The model fits the data well, and the subsequent test also supported
  the concurrent validity and the predictive validity of the model. Limitations are
  discussed further."

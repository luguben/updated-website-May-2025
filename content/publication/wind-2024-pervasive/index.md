abstract: Careless responding, where participants do not fully engage with item content,
  is pervasive in survey research. Left undetected, carelessness can compromise the
  interpretation and use of survey results, including information about participant
  locations on the construct, item difficulty, and the psychometric quality of the
  instrument. We present and illustrate a sequential procedure for evaluating response
  quality in survey research using indicators from Mokken scale analysis (MSA). We
  use a real data illustration and a simulation study to compare a sequential procedure
  to a standalone procedure. We also consider how identifying and removing responses
  with evidence of poor measurement properties affects item quality indicators. Results
  suggest that the sequential procedure was effective in identifying potentially problematic
  response patterns that may not always be captured by traditional methods for identifying
  careless responders but was not always sensitive to specific carelessness patterns.
  We discuss implications for research and practice.

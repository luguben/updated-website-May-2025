abstract: Partly spurred by the notion that celebrities wield potentials leverageable
  for political gains, the phenomenon of celebrity endorsement has become emblematic
  of political campaigns. While the use of celebrities in politics is on the ascendancy,
  its impact on electoral fortunes in bourgeoning democracies like Ghana where the
  concept is nascent, has received little research focus. Considering the anticipated
  gains, an empirical investigation in this regard will be imperative to the politics
  of transitioning polities. Against this backdrop, our study investigates the salience
  of celebrity endorsement to voters' voting intention. Employing a questionnaire-drawn
  data via the survey method, with a sample of 745, results of data analysis anchored
  on the structural equation modeling technique revealed a significant positive relationship
  between endorser credibility and political brand credibility. Similarly, study results
  confirmed the significant positive relationship between political brand credibility
  and voting intention. Finally, the significant positive relationship between endorser
  credibility and voting intention was affirmed. Overall, the study outcomes verify
  the usefulness and appropriateness of the proposed model. Based on the results,
  implications for political strategy and suggestions for further research are subsequently
  delineated.

I am a Quantatitive Methodologist. I love teaching and doing research üòä. I am interested in empirical and some methodolocal studies (applications) that employ cognitive diagnosis models, structural equation model and general statistical methods in education, psychology, and in the social and behavior sciences. Feel free to check [here](https://benjaminlugu.com/publication) or [Google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8Fn6yF4AAAAJ) for my publications. Please reach out if you'd like us to collaborate on a project.

Shout out to [Dr Wenchao Ma](https://edpsych.umn.edu/people/quantitative-methods-education-faculty/wenchao-ma) (Advisor), [Dr Stefanie Wind](https://professorwind.science/) (Supervisor) and the faculty in the [Ed. Research program at The University of Alabama](https://education.ua.edu/department/educational-studies-in-psychology-research-methodology-and-counseling/educational-research/). They helped shape my life.

Some _fun things_ I do often are: exercising, watching movies, going for a walk, driving and playing with Youtube Shorts üòÜ.

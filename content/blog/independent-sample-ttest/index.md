One sample t-test is a test used to compare the mean or average of _a single group_ to a known value such as the population average to see if they are significantly different.

For example, a researcher wants to know if the average test score of randomly selected students is significantly different from the national average score.

To ensure that your results are accurate, your data must meet the assumptions for one sample t test. These assumptions are normality, independence and random sampling. Check out my previous videos on how to check these assumptions.

To sum up, Use a one-sample t-test when comparing your sample to an existing benchmark or standard.
